This repository contains a machine learning-based web application for predicting diabetes. The prediction model is built using the Random Forest Classification algorithm, and the app is developed using Streamlit.

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App allows users to input relevant health data and receive a prediction on whether they are likely to have diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- Real-time prediction of diabetes probability
- Efficient and accurate predictions using Random Forest Classification
- Easily deployable web app using Streamlit

## How to Use

1. Enter the required health data in the app's interface.
2. Receive the prediction result indicating the likelihood of having diabetes.

## Dependencies

The app uses the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
